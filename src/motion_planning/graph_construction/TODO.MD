# Graph Construction Tasks


- [done] save all graphs in a separate folder
- [done] generate graph figures results into the results folder
- [done] generate offline problems and record them
- [done] test the generated offline problem and validate
- [done] verify the generated data for candidates_based problems and graph_based problems
- [ ] solve the offline problem by getting the optimal offline solution given all graph usint MILP method
- [ ] loading  the offline problem rb candidates
- [ ] solve the offline problem by getting the optimal offline solution as MCKP given the RB candidates only
- [ ] generate the mckp_solver results into the csv file

- [done] load the RB-offline problem, then solve it in online manner
- [done] evaluate the performance by loading the results of offline and online problems then evaluate
